# To-Do List Application with React & TypeScript

A modern, responsive to-do list application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The application allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks with a clean, dark-mode interface.

## Features

- Add new tasks with unique IDs
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (All/Active/Complete)
- Delete individual tasks
- Toggle all tasks complete/incomplete
- Remove all completed tasks at once
- Neumorphic UI design
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript

## Technologies Used

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- ShortID (for generating unique IDs)
- CSS (for neumorphic styling)
- ESLint (for code linting)

   ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server (runs on port 4000)
- `npm run build`: Build the application for production
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check for code issues
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally

## Usage

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`

3. Add new tasks using the input field
4. Manage your tasks with the following controls:

## Data Structure

### Todo Interface
```typescript
interface Todo {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  complete: boolean;
}
```

## State Management

The application uses React's useState hook for state management with:
- Todo list state
- Filter state (All/Active/Complete)
- Toggle all complete state

## Styling

The application features a neumorphic design with:
- Soft shadows for depth
- Rounded corners
- Dark theme
- Interactive hover states
- Responsive layout

## Customization

To modify the styling:
1. Edit the CSS files in the components folders
2. Change color schemes in the `TodoStyle.css` files
3. Adjust dimensions and spacing as needed
